# Minishell Project

Welcome to our **Minishell** project! This is a simplified shell built as part of the 42 curriculum. Our goal is to replicate core shell functionalities (prompt, command parsing, built-ins, pipes, redirections, and more) while maintaining robust code quality and an iterative, professional workflow.

## Project Overview

- **Subject**: Rebuild a miniature version of a UNIX shell
- **Key Features**:
  - Display a prompt and read user input

  - Handle redirections and pipes
  - Manage signals like `Ctrl-C`, `Ctrl-\`, `Ctrl-D`
- **Language**: C
